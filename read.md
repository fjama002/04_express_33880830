# Exploring Express

This small application explores Express to create a few different "routes".

These are like pages which lead you to somewhere new.

There is a welcome, about, contact and date route.

To access these pages, add the relevant page name after the user ID, like so... userID/welcome

This works on both the VM or port 8000, your choice.

I hope you enjoy!
